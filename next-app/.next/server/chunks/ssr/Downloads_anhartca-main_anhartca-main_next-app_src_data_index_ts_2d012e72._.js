        <p><em>From the Anhart Community Stories Archive - 2024</em></p>
        
        <h4>A Vision Born from Success</h4>
        <p>In his 50th year, Hart Molthagen and his wife Anita decided to give back to a nearby community from their successful business profits. In 2000 they purchased and renovated a 80 single room occupancy run down building and renamed it Jubilee Rooms.</p>
        
        <p>This initial act of community service would become the foundation for what is now one of Canada's most respected affordable housing organizations.</p>
        
        <h4>Inspiring Others to Act</h4>
        <p>In 2004, David and Lise Ash followed the inspiration of the Molthagens and purchased and renovated the 71 room Dodson Hotel. Their commitment to community development demonstrated how individual acts of generosity could create lasting change.</p>
        
        <h4>Building an Organization</h4>
        <p>Since 2002, Anhart operated and managed the renovations for the two philanthropist families. In 2013, both buildings were sold to Anhart for 50% of their fair market value - a generous gift that provided the organization with the capital and experience needed to expand their mission.</p>
        
        <h4>Expanding Impact</h4>
        <p>The generosity of the Molthagens and Ashes was also the foundation of the efforts of the Community Builders Group to house 800 at-risk persons in Vancouver's core, and the creation of Clean Start, a large community contribution company that hires persons with barriers to employment.</p>
        
        <h4>A Legacy of Community Building</h4>
        <p>What began as a single act of philanthropy has grown into a comprehensive approach to community development. From those first 151 rooms in the Jubilee and Dodson buildings, Anhart has expanded to develop hundreds of affordable housing units across Western Canada.</p>
        
        <p>The story demonstrates how individual generosity, when combined with professional management and a long-term vision, can create sustainable solutions to housing challenges that continue to benefit communities for decades.</p>
