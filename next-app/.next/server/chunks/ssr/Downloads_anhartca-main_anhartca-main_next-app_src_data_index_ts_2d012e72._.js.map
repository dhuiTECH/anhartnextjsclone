Their commitment to community development demonstrated how individual acts of generosity could create lasting change.</p>\n        \n        <h4>Building an Organization</h4>\n        <p>Since 2002, Anhart operated and managed the renovations for the two philanthropist families. In 2013, both buildings were sold to Anhart for 50% of their fair market value - a generous gift that provided the organization with the capital and experience needed to expand their mission.</p>\n        \n        <h4>Expanding Impact</h4>\n        <p>The generosity of the Molthagens and Ashes was also the foundation of the efforts of the Community Builders Group to house 800 at-risk persons in Vancouver's core, and the creation of Clean Start, a large community contribution company that hires persons with barriers to employment.</p>\n        \n        <h4>A Legacy of Community Building</h4>\n        <p>What began as a single act of philanthropy has grown into a comprehensive approach to community development. From those first 151 rooms in the Jubilee and Dodson buildings, Anhart has expanded to develop hundreds of affordable housing units across Western Canada.</p>\n        \n        <p>The story demonstrates how individual generosity, when combined with professional management and a long-term vision, can create sustainable solutions to housing challenges that continue to benefit communities for decades.</p>\n        \n        <p><em>This story is part of the Anhart Community Stories project, documenting the people and partnerships that have made affordable housing possible in communities across Canada.</em></p>`,\n  },\n];\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"0FCqCgD,CAC9C,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,gBACP,SAAU,gBACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,qJACF,MAAO,eACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,sBACN,WAAY,CACV,sCACA,iCACA,yCACA,iDACA,mCACA,yCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,eACP,SAAU,gBACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,iOACF,MAAO,iBACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,mBACN,WAAY,CACV,8BACA,4BACA,oCACA,mCACA,4BACA,kCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,YACP,SAAU,WACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,6KACF,MAAO,UACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,kBACN,WAAY,CACV,wCACA,mCACA,0CACA,gEACA,iCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,WACP,SAAU,gBACV,gBAAiB,OACjB,MAAO,GACP,YACE,gNACF,MAAO,UACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,eACN,WAAY,CACV,gDACA,2CACA,iCACA,4CACA,8BACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,kBACP,SAAU,gCACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,4LACF,MAAO,UACP,OAAQ,cACR,KAAM,YACN,WAAY,CACV,sCACA,wCACA,qCACA,iCACA,kCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,2BACP,SAAU,gBACV,KAAM,aACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,4GACF,MAAO,kBACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,0BACN,WAAY,CACV,wCACA,iCACA,4BACA,8BACD,AACH,EACD,qCCjIiC,CAChC,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,aACP,YACE,wJACF,MAAO,qBACP,UAAW,6BACX,gBACE,+JACF,UAAW,kBACb,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,WACP,YACE,iJACF,MAAO,sBACP,UAAW,qBACX,gBACE,kKACF,UAAW,gBACb,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,cACP,YACE,qKACF,MAAO,uBACP,UAAW,0BACX,gBACE,wJACF,UAAW,oBACb,EACD,4CCrBuD,CACtD,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,gBACP,SAAU,0BACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,qJACF,iBACE,oJACF,qBACE,2sBACF,MAAO,eACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,sBACN,WAAY,CACV,sCACA,iCACA,yCACA,iDACA,mCACA,yCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,YACP,SAAU,uBACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,8JACF,iBACE,uJACF,qBACE,uvBACF,MAAO,UACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,kBACN,WAAY,CACV,wCACA,mCACA,0CACA,gEACA,iCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,cACP,SAAU,gBACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,0JACF,iBACE,qIACF,qBACE,uzBACF,MAAO,UACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,eACN,WAAY,CACV,gDACA,2CACA,iCACA,4CACA,8BACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,eACP,SAAU,kCACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,6HACF,iBACE,sGACF,qBACE,6kBACF,MAAO,iBACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,mBACN,WAAY,CACV,8BACA,4BACA,oCACA,mCACA,4BACA,kCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,eACP,SAAU,oCACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,0PACF,iBACE,oGACF,qBACE,0kBACF,MAAO,SACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,oBACN,WAAY,CACV,0DACA,4EACA,mFACA,4CACA,sCACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,eACP,SAAU,2BACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,IACP,YACE,iNACF,iBACE,+HACF,qBACE,+gBACF,MAAO,WACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,mBACN,WAAY,CACV,sDACA,oDACA,+CACA,2DACA,kDACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,GACJ,MAAO,mBACP,SAAU,+BACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,EACP,YACE,wHACF,iBACE,6HACF,qBACE,4/BACF,MAAO,aACP,OAAQ,cACR,KAAM,qBACN,WAAY,CACV,iCACA,kCACA,4CACA,6BACA,0CACA,2DACA,+CAEJ,AADG,EAEH,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,kCACP,SAAU,2BACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,IACP,YACE,wJACF,iBACE,mIACF,qBACE,wnBACF,MAAO,iBACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,mBACR,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,kBACP,SAAU,gCACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YAAa,kGACb,iBACE,8JACF,qBACE,g2BACF,MAAO,UACP,OAAQ,cACR,KAAM,yBACR,EACA,CACE,GAAI,GACJ,MAAO,2BACP,SAAU,gBACV,KAAM,aACN,MAAO,KACP,YACE,6HACF,iBACE,qJACF,qBACE,mjBACF,MAAO,kBACP,OAAQ,YACR,KAAM,0BACN,WAAY,CACV,wCACA,iCACA,4BACA,iCACA,8BACA,8BACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,GACJ,MAAO,8BACP,SAAU,qBACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,+MACF,iBACE,iIACF,qBACE,g0BACF,MAAO,YACP,OAAQ,cACR,KAAM,wBACN,WAAY,CACV,yCACA,+BACA,wBACA,+BACA,kCACA,0CACD,AACH,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,aACP,SAAU,0BACV,KAAM,OACN,MAAO,GACP,YACE,wPACF,iBACE,8KACF,qBACE,o1BACF,MAAO,OACP,OAAQ,cACR,KAAM,qBACN,WAAY,CACV,8BACA,0EACA,2DACA,oDACA,+CACA,gDACD,AACH,EACD,SElMM,IAAM,EAAgC,CAC3C,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,+DACP,OAAQ,mBACR,KAAM,eACN,QAAS,+HACT,KAAM,WACN,IAAK,kGACP,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,mDACP,OAAQ,kBACR,KAAM,OACN,QAAS,+HACT,KAAM,WACN,IAAK,kDACP,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,qDACP,OAAQ,gBACR,KAAM,gBACN,QACE,mIACF,KAAM,WACN,IAAK,iIACP,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,sDACP,OAAQ,2BACR,KAAM,OACN,QACE,wIACF,KAAM,QACN,SAAU,CAAC;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;oMAsBqL,CAAC,AACnM,EACD,uBA7IwC,CACvC,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,KAAM,QACN,MAAO,gBACP,YACE,gJACF,KAAM,gBACN,UAAW,2DACX,WAAY,6CACd,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,KAAM,QACN,MAAO,uBACP,YACE,kJACF,KAAM,aACN,UAAW,2DACX,WAAY,6CACd,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,KAAM,QACN,MAAO,kBACP,YACE,kIACF,KAAM,kBACN,UAAW,2DACX,WAAY,6CACd,EACD,kBAM0C,CACzC,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,uCACP,YAAa,6GACb,KAAM,eACN,MAAO,EACP,KAAM,SACN,IArDyB,CAqDpB,4DACP,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,qCACP,YAAa,+GACb,KAAM,kBACN,MAAO,EACP,KAAM,UACN,IA7D+B,CA6D1B,mDACP,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,wCACP,YAAa,mHACb,KAAM,gBACN,MAAO,EACP,KAAM,UACN,IArEyB,CAqEpB,uDACP,EACA,CACE,GAAI,EACJ,MAAO,wCACP,YAAa,oHACb,KAAM,cACN,MAAO,GACP,KAAM,SACN,IA7EsC,CA6EjC,sDACP,EACD"}
