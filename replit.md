# Anhart Affordable Housing - Next.js Application

## Overview
This is a Next.js web application for Anhart Affordable Housing, showcasing their mission, portfolio, and partnerships in affordable housing development across British Columbia.

## Recent Changes (November 12, 2025)
- **Blog Posts Published to Supabase Database** 📝
  - All 5 blog posts migrated from static data to Supabase database
  - Blog posts: modular-housing, affordable-housing-vancouver, housing-subsidies, how-to-apply, community-impact
  - Each post includes full SEO metadata (title, description, keywords, structured data)
  - Fixed Next.js 15 breaking change: dynamic route params now properly awaited
  - Created comprehensive SUPABASE-RLS-FIX.md guide for fixing Row Level Security
  - **⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED**: Supabase RLS policy must be updated to allow anonymous reads
  - **Current Issue**: RLS policy uses `{public}` role instead of `anon`, blocking server-side fetches
  - **Impact**: Blog posts fallback to client-side rendering (works), but server-side SEO metadata is limited
  - **Fix**: Update RLS policy in Supabase dashboard to use `anon, authenticated` roles (see SUPABASE-RLS-FIX.md)

- **SEO Improvements for Google Crawling** 🔍
  - Added dynamic `generateMetadata` function in blog/[slug]/page.tsx for proper SSR SEO

  - Added SEO best practices guidance panel in admin dashboard editor
  - Guidance encourages proper H2/H3 heading usage, keyword optimization, and meta descriptions
  - Created server-side `getPostBySlugServer` function in lib/blog-server.ts for metadata generation
  - Verified all existing blog posts have proper semantic HTML (H1, H2, H3 tags)
  - Blog posts now fully crawlable by Google bots with complete metadata (once RLS is fixed)
  - **Critical Bug Fixes**:
    - Fixed null-safety crash in generateMetadata when posts lack keywords (added optional chaining)
    - Fixed invalid JSON-LD timeRequired value (now defaults to "PT5M" for missing reading_time)
    - Admin dashboard now auto-calculates reading_time (200 words per minute)
    - Admin dashboard now auto-extracts keywords from title and meta description (max 10 keywords)
    - New blog posts no longer crash during metadata generation or structured data rendering
  
- **Vercel Deployment Preparation**
  - Converted all 116 AVIF images to WebP format for Vercel compatibility
  - Updated registry.ts to use .webp imports instead of .avif
  - Removed AVIF files (Vercel doesn't support AVIF in build process)
  - Created vercel.json with Next.js framework configuration
  - Added .replit to .gitignore to prevent deployment conflicts
  - Verified local build succeeds with WebP images (builds in 15.4s)

```

## Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE**: 
The `.env` file in the `next-app/` directory contains Supabase credentials that should NOT be committed to version control. For production deployments:

1. **Remove `.env` from git tracking**: The `.env` file is now in `.gitignore` to prevent future commits
2. **Rotate exposed credentials**: The Supabase keys in the current `.env` should be considered exposed and rotated
3. **Use Replit Secrets**: Set environment variables in Replit's Secrets manager instead of committing them to the repository

### Required Environment Variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous/public key (standard Supabase naming)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: Supabase project identifier
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID`: Google Analytics tracking ID (optional)

### How to Set Environment Variables in Replit:
1. Open the "Secrets" tool in the Replit sidebar (🔒 icon)
2. Add each environment variable with its corresponding value
3. Replit will automatically inject these into your application at runtime
4. Delete the local `.env` file after setting up Replit Secrets

## Development
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start development server on port 5000
- Development server accessible at the Replit webview

### Admin & Member Portals
- **Admin Login**: `/admin/login` - Authenticate as admin (requires role='admin' in profiles table)
- **Admin Dashboard**: `/admin/dashboard` - Features:
  - Create new blog posts with TipTap rich text editor
  - Edit existing blog posts (dropdown selector loads posts for editing)
  - Comprehensive formatting toolbar: H1, H2, H3 headings, Bold, Italic, Lists, Paragraphs
  - Publish date input field (defaults to today for new posts)
  - Toggle between "New Post" and "Edit" modes
  - Auto-saves to `blog_posts` table in Supabase (including publish_date field)
  - Categories: Housing Resources, Community Impact, Housing Innovation, Insights, News, Updates, Community
- **Member Dashboard**: `/member/dashboard` - View and download files from `member-files` storage bucket
- **Blog Migration**: Script at `scripts/migrate-blog-posts.mjs` (dry-run mode works, live mode blocked by RLS policies)

### Database Requirements
The portals require these Supabase database tables:
- `profiles`: User profiles with `role` field ('admin' or 'member')
- `blog_posts`: Blog content with fields for title, slug, content, meta_description, category, etc.
- Storage bucket `member-files`: For storing member-accessible files

## Production Deployment
- Configured for Replit Autoscale deployment
- Build: `npm install && npm run build`
- Start: `npm run start` (runs on port 5000)

## Known Issues & Required Actions
- **CRITICAL**: Supabase RLS policy blocks server-side blog fetches
  - Policy uses `{public}` role instead of `anon` role
  - Fix: Update policy in Supabase dashboard to use `anon, authenticated` roles
  - See detailed instructions in `next-app/SUPABASE-RLS-FIX.md`
  - Impact: Server-side SEO metadata generation fails until RLS is fixed
  - Workaround: Blog posts fallback to client-side rendering (works, but limited SEO)
- AVIF images show warnings in Turbopack (Next.js dev mode) - images still work but are not optimized
- These warnings are cosmetic and do not affect functionality
